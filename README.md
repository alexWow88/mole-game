# mole-game
A "whacky" version of Whack-A-Mole with dangerous, bomb-having moles. A single player game which allows for high score saving so you can compete against a friend on the same device by taking turns.

## General Info 
I made this during week 4 of my software development course at _nology. 

This project was very enjoyable for me. I had full control over what features to implement and the styling and I tried to make the most of it. I hope you enjoy playing!

### Technologies used
* Javascript ES6
* HTML 5
* CSS 3/SCSS

### Rules
Whack-A-Mole is fun because it is so simple, yet manic. Just keep whacking those moles! Each hit logs 1 point and these moles don't go down easy so you can get a few hits in before they hide.

* Click the Start Button
* Either a mole or a bomb will pop out of a random hole on a timer. 
* DON'T CLICK THE BOMBS! YOU WILL LOSE 5 POINTS AND THEY EXPLODE!
* Click the moles as many times as possible when they are visible. You get 1 point for each whack.
* Game will finish after 15 seconds.
* A Game Over Screen will pop up after the game timer is out.
* Type your name and click the Submit button. If you have a top 5 score, your name will appear on the leader board!
* Click Go Again if you want to try beeting your score!
